# Data-Tetris

A custom 2v2 Tetris game based on the classic [ondras/custom-tetris](https://github.com/ondras/custom-tetris) implementation, created as an interactive marketing piece for Vintory.com. This game metaphorically demonstrates the value of quality data sourcing in property management through competitive gameplay.

## The Data Quality Metaphor

In this game, two property management companies face off: Vintory vs "Data "Я" Us". The gameplay mechanics directly reflect real-world data quality:

- **Vintory's Side**: Receives well-structured, clean data represented by easy-to-place Tetris pieces (more I, O, and L pieces). This represents Vintory's carefully vetted and properly sourced data that fits seamlessly into your business operations.

- **"Data "Я" Us" Side**: Struggles with poorly sourced data represented by difficult-to-place pieces (more Z and S pieces). This represents the challenges of working with cheap, unverified data sources that create costly problems down the line.

## Features

- 2v2 competitive gameplay demonstrating data quality impact
- Real-time visualization of data quality differences
- Interactive demonstration of how good data leads to better business outcomes
- Modern web interface showcasing the stark contrast between data sources

## Game Modes

- 2v2 Team Battle: Vintory vs "Data "Я" Us"
- Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics with a data quality twist
- Piece distribution weighted to demonstrate data quality differences

## The Message

Just as playing Tetris with well-shaped pieces leads to higher scores and cleaner boards, working with Vintory's quality data leads to:
- More efficient operations
- Lower long-term costs
- Better business outcomes
- Reduced time waste
- Higher ROI

## Technologies

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Modern CSS for styling and animations
- Real-time multiplayer networking
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Setup & Development

[Development instructions will be added as the project progresses]
